GreenDao-SQLCipher
==================

GreenDao support for SQLCipher

As we all know [greenDao](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) is a light & fast ORM solution for Android that 
maps objects to SQLite databases. Being highly optimized for Android, greenDAO offers great performance and consumes 
minimal memory. On google play has many [applications](http://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/details/greendao/greendao) 
use it, but there is a little disappointed that greenDao not support [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net/), so this project 
was born.
